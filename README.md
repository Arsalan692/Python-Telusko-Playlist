# Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repository is a collection of Python scripts and practice exercises I created nearly **5 years ago** when I first started learning Python.  
Many of these scripts were inspired by tutorials from **Telusko** and other online resources.  

It’s a snapshot of my early programming journey, showcasing the basics I learned while exploring Python for the first time.
